## Permissions Explained

The extension requests these permissions:

- **`activeTab`** - Access to the current Google Docs tab to extract links
- **`scripting`** - Ability to inject the link extraction script
- **`https://docs.google.com/*`** - Only works on Google Docs pages

## Troubleshooting

### Button Doesn't Appear
1. **Refresh the page** - Try reloading the Google Doc
2. **Check extension is enabled** - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Wait for page load** - Let the document fully load before expecting the button
4. **Use popup fallback** - Click the extension icon instead

### No Links Found
1. **Ensure document has links** - Check that there are actually hyperlinks in the document
2. **Wait for content load** - Some documents take time to fully render
3. **Try scrolling** - Scroll through the document to ensure all content is loaded
4. **Check link format** - Some embedded links might not be detected

### Links Won't Open
1. **Check popup blocker** - Disable popup blocking for Google Docs
2. **Try fewer links** - Open links in smaller batches
3. **Check link validity** - Invalid links will be marked but won't open

### Performance Issues
1. **Large documents** - Very long documents might take time to process
2. **Many links** - Documents with 50+ links might be slower
3. **Browser resources** - Close other tabs if experiencing slowdown
